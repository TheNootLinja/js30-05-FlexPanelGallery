# Javascript 30 day 05
This one was a little more challenging. It made me realize that I need to spend more time playing with css (especially flexbox) and what can be done with just vanilla javascript which I guess is the purpose of this course! Overall, I had to check in a few times with the video but in the end, I had a working project for the day!
